\section{Problem Statement}
Let's do a list. Lists are great. The four questions of interest are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do students exhibit patterns in testing and iteration? What are those patterns?
\item What characteristics of a design activity elicit specific iteration patterns?
\item What is the correlation between iteration in designing and success of the design?
\item What guidelines can be written for the creation of future activities?
\end{itemize}
