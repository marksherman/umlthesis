I would like to first thank someone for being so inclusive towards me. She involved me in her work, where I learned about many of the foundational works that appear in this document. It was not just about getting sources for the literature review, it was about having an experienced colleague.  She taught me that everything is always a learning process, for students, teachers, and researchers alike.
